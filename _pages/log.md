### Week: June 14, 2021
 * Worked on Chapter 3 first sentences.
 * Started Chapter 4 and 5 (first sentences).
 * Continued with TAMU data analysis. Long scrub cycles are causing two problems in memory. The first one happens after computing offsets of huge amounts of data. This one was solved by partitioning the data. The other problem is that the scrub cycle itself is long. I am working on soving this one. So far, I tried breaking up the scrub cycle and recombining the data (this is the naive and not the best solution). I am also updating the code to pandas 1.2.4 version. The code was created before pandas 1.0 was released, hence, it has some room of improvement.
